## Overview

Ripser++ takes advantage of the inherent parallelism in the computation of Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes. It boasts significant improvements in speed, CPU memory efficiency, and GPU memory usage compared to its predecessor, Ripser.

## Features

- **Performance**: Achieves up to 30x speedup over the total execution time of Ripser.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Up to 2.0x CPU memory efficiency and up to 1.58x reduction in the GPU memory usage compared to Ripser.
- **Parallelism**: Massively parallelizes the filtration construction with clearing stage and identifies hidden parallelism from matrix reduction, all executed on the GPU.
